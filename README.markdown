# Troll

Troll is a bullshit-free test runner for Lua.

## Installation

Don't install this; it is definitely not finished.

## What about Busted?

[Busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/) is a fine project, with slightly
different aims. It has more features, dependencies, and seems to be unusable on
half the systems I've installed it on.

Troll aims to be the smallest possible test runner that gets shit done. It
provides 4 functions, and a script that loads and runs tests, and that's it.
Troll is simple and dumb because tests should be simple and dumb.

If you prefer Ruby's Minitest to Rspec, this is the test runner you are looking
for.
